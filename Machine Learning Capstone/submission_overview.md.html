      The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the
      outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs.
      Your presentation will develop into a story of all your machine learning journey in this project, and it should be compelling and easy to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next exercise, you can find a provided PowerPoint template to help you get started to
      create a report in slides format. There are placeholders in the template for each of the required elements of the project,
      and that instructions are provided on each slide. You need to delete and replace the placeholders with the actual content.
      However, you are encouraged to add additional elements such as slides, charts, and tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a total of 70 points possible points for the final assessment,
      and you will be graded by your peers, who are also completing this assignment.
    </p>
    <p>The main grading criteria will be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uploaded your completed presentation in PDF format (2 pts)</li>
